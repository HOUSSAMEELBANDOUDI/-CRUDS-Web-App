# 🧾 CRUDS Web App (Create - Read - Update - Delete - Search)

## 📌 About the Project

This project is a complete implementation of **CRUD** operations, extended to **CRUDS** by adding a **Search** feature.

It is built using:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
- LocalStorage to store data persistently in the browser

## 🧩 What is CRUDS?

| Letter | Operation        |
|--------|------------------|
| C      | Create – Add new data |
| R      | Read – View/display data |
| U      | Update – Edit existing data |
| D      | Delete – Remove data |
| S      | Search – Find data based on a query |

These are the five essential operations when working with data in any application.
